# SearchEngine

This is a project completed through the course MSCI 541 at the University of Waterloo under Doctor Mark Smucker. 

The project explores the creation of a simple but effective search engine in which data from a newspaper source can be read and then searched on. 

This is accomplished through creating an inverted index and utilising BM25 ranking algorithm to find suitable results for search terms.
